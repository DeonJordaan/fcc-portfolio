		<h4>Project Brief</h4>
		<p>
			For this project, the brief was to build a task log viewer to allow the
			team members to easily scan and analyze the data collected from their
			various customer facing applications. As the company offers a wide variety
			of services and processes large amounts of data, the viewer needed to be
			simple to use and allow for fast navigation and retrieval of information.
		</p>
		<h4>Web Stack</h4>
		<p>
			I was given free reign to implement the project using any tools or
			technologies I wanted. With the help of the lead developer, the SQL
			database was setup on my system to enable my application to interact with
			the data. Having recently started learning React I decided to use it to
			build out the project.<br />The component-based architecture and the
			interchangeability it offers really appeal to my logical thinking.
			Furthermore, the repetitive presentation of a stack of infinitely nested
			data seemed the perfect use case to make use of reusable components.
		</p>
		<p>
			To plan the project, I used Figma as I found it intuitive to use. This was
			especially helpful when it came to analyzing the layout to ensure the
			interface was as usable as possible.
		</p>
		<h4>Thought Process</h4>
		<p>
			My highest priority was to present the data as clearly as possible. This
			was challenging given the amount of data that needed to be presented and
			the limited screen real estate at my disposal. It was while researching
			best practices, that I learned the nuanced difference between legibility
			and readability. This guided my choice of font as well as teaching me to
			pay attention to the effect a small change in spacing and contrast can
			have.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to make interpretation of the data as efficient as possible, I
			used color to communicate important information. This allows the user to
			both find this information quickly and to consume it instantly without the
			need to read and process the text.
		</p>
		<h4>Forthcoming Improvements</h4>
		<p>
			I'm currently building a data-worker component to separate the data
			processing functionality from the rest of the components. This worker will
			incorporate a Fetch request builder that will communicate with the
			backend. Once the data is received, it will process this data as required
			and then pass it to the main event context.<br />
			While the application will almost exclusively be used in a work and office
			environment on desktop PCs, I intend to make it fully responsive across
			the full spectrum of devices. Presenting data on smaller devices is
			particularly challenging and this will give me invaluable experience in
			creating useable, responsive applications.<br />Currently the Hierarchy
			View displays the selected sub-event. This will be expanded to show the
			nested layers as the user clicks through the data. The filtering component
			will be completed to allow specific filtering by Host, as well as the
			ability to filter by 'Date' and 'Application'.
		</p>
		<h4>What I Learned</h4>
		<p>
			The biggest challenge was working out the cause and effect of the
			rendering (and re-rendering) of components. Coupled with the effects of
			hooks and how they are intertwined with this process, this proved really
			tricky to wrap my head around.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's another tangled web analogy in there for sure and mostly it felt
			like it was wrapped around my head instead! Needless to say, it's going to
			take some time to really grasp these concepts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another realization was just how important it is to really get stuck in
			and apply what I'd learned. I found it difficult to properly plan the
			layout of components and the flow of data between them, simply because I
			hadn't the ability to form clear mental models of how they would normally
			interact. Thus I found it easier to actually start building a basic
			structure and once it started taking shape, I was able to see a clearer
			path forward and make adjustments to my original plans. With experience,
			this understanding will become intuitive.
