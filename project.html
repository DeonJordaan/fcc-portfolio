			<!-- <h4>Project Brief</h4> -->
			<p>
				For this project, the brief was to build a task log viewer to allow team
				members to easily scan and analyze the data collected from the company's
				various customer facing applications. Due to this data not being easily
				accessible in the past, the information was not being accessed and used.
				As the company offers a wide variety of services and processes large
				amounts of data, the tool needed to be simple to use and allow for fast
				navigation and retrieval of information.

					<h4>Tools & Tech</h4>
					<div class="section__tools--content-text">
						<p>
							I was given free reign to implement the project using any tools or
							technologies I wanted. With the help of the lead developer, the
							SQL database was setup on my system to enable my application to
							interact with the data. Having recently started learning React I
							decided to use it to build out the project.<br />The
							component-based architecture and the interchangeability it offers
							really appeal to my logical thinking. Furthermore, the repetitive
							presentation of a stack of infinitely nested data seemed the
							perfect use case to make use of reusable components.
						</p>
						<p>
							To plan the project, I used Figma as I found it intuitive to use.
							This was especially helpful when it came to analyzing the layout
							to ensure the interface was as usable as possible.

						<h4>Thought Process</h4>
						<div class="section__process--content">
							<p>
								My highest priority was to present the data as clearly as
								possible. This was challenging given the amount of data that
								needed to be presented and the limited screen real estate at my
								disposal. It was while researching best practices, that I
								learned the nuanced difference between legibility and
								readability. This guided my choice of font as well as teaching
								me to pay attention to the effect a small change in spacing and
								contrast can have.
							</p>
							<p>
								In order to make interpretation of the data as efficient as
								possible, I used color to communicate important information.
								This allows the user to both find this information quickly and
								to consume it instantly without the need to read and process the
								text.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="section__improvements">
						<h4>Forthcoming Improvements</h4>
						<div class="section__improvements--content">
							<p>
								I am currently completing a custom useFetch hook to make the
								process of fetching data more efficient. I'm also exploring the
								possibility of building a data-worker component to separate the
								data processing functionality from the rest of the components.
								The idea is that this component fetches and processes the data
								before passing it to the main event context.<br />
								While the application will almost exclusively be used in a work
								and office environment on desktop PCs, I intend to make it fully
								responsive across the full spectrum of devices. Presenting data
								on smaller devices is particularly challenging and this will
								give me invaluable experience in creating usable, responsive
								applications.<br />Currently the Hierarchy View displays the
								selected sub-event. This will be expanded to show the nested
								layers as the user clicks through the data. The filtering
								component will be completed to allow specific filtering by Host,
								as well as the ability to filter by 'Date' and 'Application'.

				<h4>What I Learned</h4>
				<div class="section__learned--content">
					<p>
						The biggest challenge was working out the cause and effect of the
						rendering (and re-rendering) of components. Coupled with the effects
						of hooks and how they are intertwined with this process, this proved
						really tricky to wrap my head around.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's another tangled web analogy in there for sure and mostly it
						felt like it was wrapped around my head instead! Needless to say,
						it's going to take some time to really grasp these concepts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another realization was just how important it is to really get stuck
						in and apply what I'd learned. I found it difficult to properly plan
						the layout of components and the flow of data between them, simply
						because I hadn't the ability to form clear mental models of how they
						would normally interact. Thus I found it easier to actually start
						building a basic structure and once it started taking shape, I was
						able to see a clearer path forward and make adjustments to my
						original plans. With experience, this understanding will become
						intuitive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moving forward, I look forward to adding the above-mentioned
						improvements and then working with the team and using their feedback
						to further refine the tool.
					</p>
					<p>One step at a time.</p>
